# Romance them Robots

My first ever coding project, a super hot human-on-robot dating simulator, sure to end with kisses and romance and probably 
barely any existential panic at all.

Made with Ren'Py and Photoshop, with some creative commons images ganked from https://www.pexels.com for backgrounds.
